# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts:** After losing my streak a couple of weeks ago I got back on track for about four days then lost another day. Starting from Day 1 again today.

### Day 2: June 5, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the header on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project. I put the rest of the HTML page structure in place. 

**Thoughts:** My goal is to try and create each part of the page from memory as much as possible without referring to outside materials. This is good practice and I quickly realize where the gaps in my knowledge are (I have more gap than actual knowledge). I'm getting practice ideas and thinking of ways to solidify my understanding, like building a new header from scratch every day until I feel confident about building them. Then if I can do a header, doing a footer might be easier to master, etc. Also, going back through the Traversy Media tutorials and doing those from memory might be good. But to be honest, I'm feeling discouraged this morning, like I'm deluding myself. I can fill out these logs and do all these tutorials, but deep down I fear that I'm just doing 'busy work' to feel like I'm 'accomplishing' something when in reality I'm not actually getting better or applying myself, just spinning my wheels and patting myself on the back for it.

### Day 3: June 6, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out the header after some research and digging.

**Thoughts:** I felt discouraged while struggling but ultimately I figured out the problem and it got worked out.

### Day 4: June 7, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Hacking away at the showcase part of the product landing page project. I got some images from Pexel.com to work with.

**Thoughts:** Started building up the showcase and found some images to work with. My workflow is unorganized and my progress is pretty slow. I'm not putting in enough time day-to-day Or rather, I'm not making as much progress as I feel like I should be in a single day. Maybe for practice when I finish the certificate I should go back and work towards redoing the projects and finishing them in a single sitting.

### Day 6: June 8, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got the showcase and features sections worked out, imported a font to use, and learned how to make videos embedded with iframes responsive.

**Thoughts:** The pattern of failing to express what's in your head, struggling to correct mistakes, and then fixing things through learning is swell. 

### Day 7: June 9, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got 15 out 16 tests passing on the product landing page, just need to add media queries to finish. I still want to make the layout less sloppy and tighten up responsiveness. Also started The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I'm so lazy and unfocused. In the back of my mind I know I what I need to do (put in the time and get confident with everything I'm learning), and it haunts me until I sit down and put in the work. Then I feel great.

### Day 8: June 10, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added product cards/pricing to the fCC product landing page and watched a few more videos in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** One of the first times where I wasn't staring at the clock waiting until I had 'put my time in for the day.' I was engaged in the creating/coding process and was enjoying putting things together and tweaking everything until it looked how I wanted. Good stuff!

### Day 9: June 11, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Product Landing Page. In the end I couldn't get the product buttons responsive. Tried fixing with relative parent - absolute child positioning but then it broke scrolling behind the header. All tests passed, though.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to 'finish' the project. I'm just going to keep moving on to the next one and not get hung up on the responsive button thing.

### Day 10: June 12, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did most of the Introductory HTML lessons in the Web Development Bootcamp. Learned about quirks mode and standards mode in browsers.

**Thoughts:** Got to working on this late today. I worry that my progress is going too slowly.

### Day 11: June 13, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introductory HTML section and worked through a few of the intermediate HTML lessons in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I like the pace of the course. Balancing these tutorials with the more creative fCC projects is keeping things fresh for me.

### Day 12: June 14, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through most of the rest of the Intermediate HTML lesson in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Revisited tables for the first time in a long time. I have little experience actually creating them.

### Day 13: June 15, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Set up the HTML structure and some css for the Technical Documentation project page on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I don't know why but it's hard for me to enjoy these projects. It's good just-do-it-regardless-of-how-you-feel-about-it practice.

### Day 14: June 16, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Intermediate HTML section of the Web Developer Bootcamp and the form exercise. Learned about password/input length validations.

**Thoughts:** I didn't quite get the form 1-to-1 with the conditions given. I got most of the way there and learned.

### Day 15: June 17, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation page project.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't inspired or excited by this project, but every time I get to work on something that feels boring and tedious at first I end up enjoying some aspect of trying to put it all together. Also, coolors.co is a great resource for choosing color schemes. All you have to do is hit spacebar to get a set of new complementary colors and their hex values.

### Day 16: June 18, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started and worked through the Introctory CSS lesson in the Web Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Pretty basic stuff, just grinding through.

### Day 17: June 19, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Introductory CSS lesson in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp

**Thoughts:** Just pushing forward.

### Day 18: June 20, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the Intermediate CSS section in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp and did the Tic Tac Toe exercise.

**Thoughts:** Still pushing forward.

### Day 19: June 21, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the photo gallery and blog post exercises in Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp course, finishing the Intermediate CSS section.

**Thoughts:** I've started completing exercises on my own and then heavily commenting my code while correcting my solution as I follow along with the video solution. Helps solidify things.

### Day 20: June 22, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started working through the Bootstrap portion of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Learned some basics like forms, buttons, and how to make a navbar.

**Thoughts:** Really interesting. It's nice to feel like I'm moving on to the next step beyond just vanilla HTML and CSS.

### Day 21: June 23, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working through the Bootstrap portion of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. Working on grids.

**Thoughts:** I had all day off today, but I put the coding stuff off the very end of the day.

### Day 22: June 24, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: A lot of issues today, mainly with icons not showing up and then suddenly deciding to show up (???), but I finished a bootstrap image gallery tutorial and grew a little. Also, learned that spaces in filenames are a no-no.

**Thoughts:** Time flies when you're struggling.

### Day 23: June 25, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Bootstrap 3 section of the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Easy peasy. But I'll need to review this stuff, of course.

### Day 24: June 26, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio project, but ended up cleaning up the Product Landing Page project. Hit a snag with the navbar covering up hashtag link content.

**Thoughts:** I searched for solutions to the navbar/hashtag cover problem, but none of them work. There's something fundamental I'm not understanding.

### Day 25: June 27, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Not a very motivated day. Just going through the motions. Do I even enjoy this? Started the Bootstrap 4 section of the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm wanting to start learning JS but I keep putting off the fCC Portfolio Project. 

### Day 26: June 28, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Built up the HTML structure for my personal portfolio page on freeCodeCamp. With the portfolio page I really need to go back to the other projects and make sure they're presentable.

**Thoughts:** Zero drive. No motivation. What am I doing? I have no focus, or a drive to have one focus. I'm just average. I want to be happy and content with average. The idea that *I* have to be *above* average feels like a disease that won't go away and is slowly robbing me of joy and driving me with fear and anxiety bread from a sense of fundamental inadequacy. I'm lazy.

### Day 27: June 29, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today was just a mindless-tutorial-follow-along day. Bootstrap 4 typography, spacing, and breakpoints on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Not proud of my progress.

### Day 28: June 30, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Bootstrap 4 navbars, display utility, and flexbox lessons on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. Also looked into Japanese YouTube web dev videos. 

**Thoughts:** Today I felt better mentally.

###Day 29: July 1, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Bootstrap 4 flexbox utility lessons on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. I also made headway in my free Code Camp portfolio project; I realized I hadn't linked my HTML and CSS files.

**Thoughts:** Mentally feeling on the up.

###Day 30: July 2, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my fCC portfolio page, mainly on the main .welcome-section. I imported the Final Fantasy VII font and added the google Raleway font as a fallback. I usd tweaked FFVII default menu colors for the background.

**Thoughts:** I have more fun creating original things.

###Day 31: July 3, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the navs + flexbox and Bootstrap 4 grid lessons on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm at a low, just going through the motions.

###Day 32: July 4, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Patterns Project and the grid + flexbox lessons on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** My days have been very busy and the coding has taken a backseat, both schedule-wise and mentally.

###Day 33: July 5, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finally made myself sit down and start pushing through the freeCodeCamp portfolio project. The notes and comments in the solution's code on codepen are really thorough and nice. I looked into whether or not to use rem, em, or px units for breakpoints.

**Thoughts:** Once I start doing work I never regret it; in fact it usually feels great, but getting started is the hardest part.

###Day 34: July 6, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the fCC portfolio page, coding along with the solution and looking up answers to questions I had.

**Thoughts:** Just grinding.

###Day 35: July 7, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the fCC portfolio page. Coding along with the solution has really helped.

**Thoughts:** Just grinding some more.

###Day 36: July 8, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: FINALLY finished the fCC portfolio page project. I can finally move on to Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Finally. Why did that take me so long? Lack of focus and determination.

###Day 37: July 9, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started Javascript on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be moving on to something fresh.

###Day 38: July 10, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued lessons in the Basic Javascript portion of freeCodeCamp. Got stuck on a function problem. Very frustrating because I know I understand the ideas, but I feel like what's being asked for isn't very clear.

**Thoughts:** A little brick wall today.

###Day 39: July 11, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Solved the problem I was stuck on after checking myself and then watching the first part of a solution video. Continued on with Basic Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Demoralized. Furious at how my solution kept getting denied because it wasn't done in the specific way fCC wanted it, even though mine output the same result. 

###Day 40: July 12, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: A light day. I had some small congnition bumps with a couple of the problems.

**Thoughts:** Today was a short session. Only 20 mins at the very end of the day before bed.

###Day 41: July 13, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Another light day working through Basic Javascript in fCC.

**Thoughts:** I did an hour, pretty smooth.

###Day 42: July 14, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More Basic Javascript of fCC.

**Thoughts:** I've clearly taken a turn in motivation, drive, and focus. My heart's fallen out of it, and when I force myself to just show up I'm not sure how much I retain.

###Day 43: July 15, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More Basic Javascript of fCC, but I got stuck on the Record Collection problem.

**Thoughts:** Went to bed frustrated with this one. I haven't been waking up early and doing the code first thing in the morning for a couple of weeks. Lately I've just been putting it off until the very end of the day, dreading it. Once I get going it's okay. Starting is the tough part.

###Day 44: July 16, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I went back and refreshed my memory on commands needed to complete the Record Collection problem.

**Thoughts:** Short session. Twenty minutes, again at the end of the day. Why am I doing this?

###Day 45: July 17, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did a little work on the Museum of Candy project in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good.

###Day 46: July 18, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Did more work on the Museum of Candy project in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course. Worked on media queries and fluid containers.

**Thoughts:** I enjoy coding along.

###Day 47: July 19, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Musuem of Candy project in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course and went on to the Javascript unit.

**Thoughts:** A good solid hour.

###Day 48: July 20, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about five Javascript primitives (number, string, boolean, null, and undefined) in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** Not much actual coding, more like knowledge building.

###Day 49: July 21, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: My computer went on the fritz today. The desktop won't load and I can't use it, basically. Read from HTML & CSS by John Duckett.

**Thoughts:** Janky computer is frustrating.

###Day 50: July 22, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Computer still not working. Started reading jQuery & Javascript by John Duckett.

**Thoughts:** Reading is a nice break from coding, but I'm not making any progress. I'm being lazy and not applying myself.

###Day 51: July 23, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: My computer went on the fritz today. The desktop won't load and I can't use it, basically. Read from HTML & CSS by John Duckett.

**Thoughts:** Janky computer is frustrating.

###Day 52: July 24, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: No reading, no coding, just googling and using the Windows Command Prompt to run some scan and repair programs.

**Thoughts:** I feel ashamed of my lack of progress and lack of discipline.

###Day 53: July 25, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Computer started working fine, same as usual... It's so janky and unreliable and I never understand why it crashes, freezes, or otherwise decides to randomly crap out (i.e. not displaying the desktop and running ridiculously slow). Also, it can't ever finish an update. It always fails and has to undo its changes. Repair attempts using a boot drive never work either. Again, I don't know why. I don't know what causes problems, and then the tools that are supposed to fix the problems don't/won't/can't fix the problems, and I don't know why. I feel like I'm at the mercy of random janky forces or jankiness and instability.

**Thoughts:**
