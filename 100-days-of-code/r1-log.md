**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts:** After losing my streak a couple of weeks ago I got back on track for about four days then lost another day. Starting from Day 1 again today.

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the header on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts:** My goal is to try and create each part of the page from memory as much as possible without referring to outside materials. This is good practice and I quickly realize where the gaps in my knowledge are (I have more gap than actual knowledge). I'm getting practice ideas and thinking of ways to solidify my understanding, like building a new header from scratch every day until I feel confident about building them. Then if I can do a header, doing a footer might be easier to master, etc. Also, going back through the Traversy Media tutorials and doing those from memory might be good. But to be honest, I'm feeling discouraged this morning, like I'm deluding myself. I can fill out these logs and do all these tutorials, but deep down I fear that I'm just doing 'busy work' to feel like I'm 'accomplishing' something when in reality I'm not actually getting better or applying myself, just spinning my wheels and patting myself on the back for it.
