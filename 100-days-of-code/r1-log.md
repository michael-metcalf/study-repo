# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 10, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Been reading and working through JavaScript on freeCodeCamp for the last two weeks. I had a day off, so back to 0 on 100DoC (which feels a little silly, but helpful?)...still scraping it. I DID finally crack the Record Collection problem on fCC, though.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to finally break through the Record Collection barrier in fCC. After solving the problem by myself through a lot of trial and error and brain-racking I looked at the fCC solution and learned even more about how the code could have been more streamlined. And I looked up a video solution on YouTube and found yet another solution. It was cool seeing multiple solutions to the same problem.

### Day 2: September 11, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed further into Jon Duckett's JavaScript and moved on to loops in freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I'm in this slow-going knowledge-absorption phase and I'm not really building anything, which makes me nervous. I feel like I still need to accumulate more knowledge of the basics before I can start to really get my hands dirty.

### Day 3: September 12, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a light day. Just some reading of Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS. I haven't worked with them in a while so it was nice and refreshing to visit that mindset.

**Thoughts:** Very light day. I was hanging out with friends for most of the evening.

### Day 4: September 13, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of the Basic JavaScript section on freeCodeCamp. I was having a lot of trouble with the Profile Lookup problem, but after a lot of struggle I finally solved it on my own.

**Thoughts:** I was having a lot of trouble with the Profile Lookup problem, but after a lot of struggle I finally solved it on my own. Again, I looked up the fCC solution to see what I could learn from it. 

### Day 4: September 14, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Basic JavaScript section on freeCodeCamp and moved on to ES6. 

**Thoughts:** When I solved the Math.random() problem I found out it was a fluke when I looked at the fCC solution. I wasn't supposed to leave a chance of the function returning 0 (the fCC solution used a while loop to keep running Math.random() if the result was 0). My passing the solution was just down to Math.random() conveniently returning a number that wasn't 0.

### Day 4: September 15, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I worked through most of the Objects section on Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm better grasping the concept and syntax of navigation objects, as well as refactoring logic into separate functions.

### Day 5: September 16, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about adding methods to objects, finishing the Objects section on Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp, and I started the section on DOM Manipulation. I started working through ES6 on freeCodeCamp and watched a lot of YouTube vids.

**Thoughts:** Today felt more productive than most. I wasn't at my ideal discipline level and I could have done more, but I should give myself at least some credit for doing what work I did today.

### Day 6: September 17, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I struggled through a few ES6 problems on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Today was the first time all of the brackets and parentheses in all of the functions started to confuse me. I had to really slow down and think to try and understand how everything was working. I got frustrated trying to understand the wording of the problems on fCC. I also started having to do a lot of Googling to understand things that weren't explained/explained clearly in the problems (arrow functions, .filter(), .map(), .reduce(), chaining functions, the rest operator). I struggled for a long time, throwing darts in the dark sometimes, but I eventually solved the problems. That felt good and satisfying, and I did feel some accomplishment from doing the little bit of detective work required on my own to figure things out. BUT I also felt powerless at the same time. I felt like I didn't actually figure anything out consciously, but that after spending some arbitrary amount of time struggling and being frustrated something in my brain decided, out of my control, to reveal a certain aspect of the problem that I hadn't noticed or considered, which lead to me solving it. It feels like a half-victory. I don't feel wiser or smarter. I feel like I'm still dumb but that some random thing inside my brain swooped in to save me after a long time of struggle.

### Day 7: September 18, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I struggled through more ES6 problems on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I hit a brick wall with an ES6 problem. I think I'm being hindered by the way I approach word problem and the example solutions given in the explanations for the concepts. I try and mimic the example concept solution logic in the solution for the actual problem, and it almost always backfires. Instead of thinking about the specific problem at hand, I try and force the same pattern/logic from the example concept solution onto the real problem. I'm stumped and frustrated tonight.

### Day 8: September 19, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read and referred to sections in Jon Duckett's JavaScript to try and better understand functions and methods and how they worked. I also backtracked in the freeCodeCamp Javascript curriculum to reinforce my knowledge and understanding.

**Thoughts:** There was no information about ES6 and arrow functions, which is what I need to understand to break through the problem.

### Day 9: September 20, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Read forward through more of Jon Duckett's JavaScript and watched some YouTube videos explaining arrow functions in ES6. I feel more comfortable with the concept.

**Thoughts:** Still no breakthrough with the problem I was stuck on. A light day.

### Day 10: September 21, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: After struggling with the ES6 problem I was stuck on for so long, I tried putting the code into the console on Google Chrome. I got the answer with my solution, but  freeCodeCamp's tests weren't passing. Not understanding why, I caved and started to look at the hints and got the solution. I pushed on through a few more problems in the ES6 section.

**Thoughts:** I feel a little ashamed for looking up hints, but I had no idea why fCC's tests weren't passing my solution. I couldn't understand the feedback under the code window ("half is not a function"???). I think this just highlights a fault in my problem solving abilities. I.e. They're very lacking. I need to slow down and consider the wording slowly and carefully one word at a time. I still feel lost sometimes, though. Constantly hitting walls with no idea or understanding of why my solution to a problem doesn't work and what the errors my solution throws mean hurts my confidence in my abilities. I shouldn't take my low opinion of myself too seriously, though. A part of me believes I can learn and change and develop the necessary skills to be a good programmer and developer. Keep pushing forward.

### Day 11: September 22, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Decent progress and productivity. Progressed through the Udemy WebDev Bootcamp, working through DOM selector methods and selecting and manipulating the style of elements. HTML, CSS, and JS are starting to intersect now.

**Thoughts:** I feel positive about today's work. It's a move in a good direction. I used the pomodoro technique for my study. I did four pomodoro's and styed realtively focused. I also tried watching the course videos at faster speeds. I like it.

### Day 12: September 23, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the DOM Manipulation section of the Udemy Web Dev Bootcamp. I watch a lot of YouTube everyday, mostly self-taught webdev-centric videos. I never measured how much time I actually spend (waste?) watching them, but today I did: 3 hours. Compared to 1.5 hrs of working along with the Udemy course...

**Thoughts:** I should readjust my video-watching to coding ratio. I would feel much happier if I had spent 4.5 hours coding today... I do sometimes glean some good insights from the videos, but I'm not sure it's worth all of that time.

### Day 13: September 24, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through Intro to Events and did a color toggle exercise. Also did another ES6 problem on freeCodeCamp and google more about 'this' and constructor functions. Watched considerably less YouTube.

**Thoughts:** Feels good learning new things. I didn't do a whole lot today, but I stopped at a point where I'm eager to learn more in the next session.

### Day 14: September 25, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: A real short session. Worked through most of the Score Card Project part 1. A lot of YouTube, but also a lot of insights. 

**Thoughts:** I still haven't committed 100% to a goal, and I think that's why I try and get so many 'angles' on development from various sources. I'm trying to put together a picture in my head and understand what I'm wanting to pursue.

### Day 15: September 26, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Score Card project.

**Thoughts:** Trying to stay rational and not psych myself out and catastrophize about my future.

### Day 16: September 27, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation portion of the Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** A good productive day. I also started doing research in C# .NET and looking into learning paths for that.
