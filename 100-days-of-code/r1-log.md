# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 15, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through functions on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Fell off the horse for a couple of weeks. The catalyst was Windows update borking my computer. I nibbled on and off for a little bit, but I'm recommitting today.

### Day 2: August 16, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about scope and higher order functions on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. Also, Dylan Israel released his podcast, Self-Taught or Not, with Erick Hanchett. I look forward to listening to it.

**Thoughts:** Getting recommitted feels good, but I also need to not be so hard on myself for not adhering to some arbitrary metric like "coding for one hour for 100 days." Be chill, be CONSISTENT, and ENJOY the learning. Don't fret over arbitrary things like *how long* you *learned/studied* coding each day. The question is: Did you *learn* something new today? Did you make even a little *forward* progress, even just 1%? You're okay. You're good to go. Just make sure you're *going*.

### Day 3: August 17, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Read some of Jon Duckett's JavaScript. Learned about the document model, that JavaScript is an interpreted language and that most major browser's have these interpreters built in, and the concept of separation of concerns.

**Thoughts:** A lazy day, to be honest. I'm not really "gunning for it." But I did recommit and I need to make an effort to stick to that, if anything just so I can believe in myself as someone who can finish what they say they're going to finish.
