# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 10, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Been reading and working through JavaScript on freeCodeCamp for the last two weeks. I had a day off, so back to 0 on 100DoC (which feels a little silly, but helpful?)...still scraping it. I DID finally crack the Record Collection problem on fCC, though.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to finally break through the Record Collection barrier in fCC. After solving the problem by myself through a lot of trial and error and brain-racking I looked at the fCC solution and learned even more about how the code could have been more streamlined. And I looked up a video solution on YouTube and found yet another solution. It was cool seeing multiple solutions to the same problem.

### Day 2: September 11, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Progressed further into Jon Duckett's JavaScript and moved on to loops in freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** I'm in this slow-going knowledge-absorption phase and I'm not really building anything, which makes me nervous. I feel like I still need to accumulate more knowledge of the basics before I can start to really get my hands dirty.

### Day 3: September 12, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today was a light day. Just some reading of Jon Duckett's HTML & CSS. I haven't worked with them in a while so it was nice and refreshing to visit that mindset.

**Thoughts:** Very light day. I was hanging out with friends for most of the evening.

### Day 4: September 13, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of the Basic JavaScript section on freeCodeCamp. I was having a lot of trouble with the Profile Lookup problem, but after a lot of struggle I finally solved it on my own.

**Thoughts:** I was having a lot of trouble with the Profile Lookup problem, but after a lot of struggle I finally solved it on my own. Again, I looked up the fCC solution to see what I could learn from it. 

### Day 4: September 14, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the Basic JavaScript section on freeCodeCamp and moved on to ES6. 

**Thoughts:** When I solved the Math.random() problem I found out it was a fluke when I looked at the fCC solution. I wasn't supposed to leave a chance of the function returning 0 (the fCC solution used a while loop to keep running Math.random() if the result was 0). My passing the solution was just down to Math.random() conveniently returning a number that wasn't 0.

### Day 4: September 15, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I worked through most of the Objects section on Udemy's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm better grasping the concept and syntax of navigation objects, as well as refactoring logic into separate functions.
