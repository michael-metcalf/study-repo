# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started working on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project.

**Thoughts:** After losing my streak a couple of weeks ago I got back on track for about four days then lost another day. Starting from Day 1 again today.

### Day 2: June 5, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still struggling with the header on freeCodeCamp's Product Landing Page project. I put the rest of the HTML page structure in place. 

**Thoughts:** My goal is to try and create each part of the page from memory as much as possible without referring to outside materials. This is good practice and I quickly realize where the gaps in my knowledge are (I have more gap than actual knowledge). I'm getting practice ideas and thinking of ways to solidify my understanding, like building a new header from scratch every day until I feel confident about building them. Then if I can do a header, doing a footer might be easier to master, etc. Also, going back through the Traversy Media tutorials and doing those from memory might be good. But to be honest, I'm feeling discouraged this morning, like I'm deluding myself. I can fill out these logs and do all these tutorials, but deep down I fear that I'm just doing 'busy work' to feel like I'm 'accomplishing' something when in reality I'm not actually getting better or applying myself, just spinning my wheels and patting myself on the back for it.

### Day 3: June 6, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Figured out the header after some research and digging.

**Thoughts:** I felt discouraged while struggling but ultimately I figured out the problem and it got worked out.

### Day 4: June 7, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Hacking away at the showcase part of the product landing page project. I got some images from Pexel.com to work with.

**Thoughts:** Started building up the showcase and found some images to work with. My workflow is unorganized and my progress is pretty slow. I'm not putting in enough time day-to-day Or rather, I'm not making as much progress as I feel like I should be in a single day. Maybe for practice when I finish the certificate I should go back and work towards redoing the projects and finishing them in a single sitting.

### Day 6: June 8, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got the showcase and features sections worked out, imported a font to use, and learned how to make videos embedded with iframes responsive.

**Thoughts:** The pattern of failing to express what's in your head, struggling to correct mistakes, and then fixing things through learning is swell. 

### Day 7: June 9, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Got 15 out 16 tests passing on the product landing page, just need to add media queries to finish. I still want to make the layout less sloppy and tighten up responsiveness. Also started The Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** I'm so lazy and unfocused. In the back of my mind I know I what I need to do (put in the time and get confident with everything I'm learning), and it haunts me until I sit down and put in the work. Then I feel great.

### Day 8: June 10, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added product cards/pricing to the fCC product landing page and watched a few more videos in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** One of the first times where I wasn't staring at the clock waiting until I had 'put my time in for the day.' I was engaged in the creating/coding process and was enjoying putting things together and tweaking everything until it looked how I wanted. Good stuff!

### Day 9: June 11, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp Product Landing Page. In the end I couldn't get the product buttons responsive. Tried fixing with relative parent - absolute child positioning but then it broke scrolling behind the header. All tests passed, though.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to 'finish' the project. I'm just going to keep moving on to the next one and not get hung up on the responsive button thing.

### Day 10: June 12, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did most of the Introductory HTML lessons in the Web Development Bootcamp. Learned about quirks mode and standards mode in browsers.

**Thoughts:** Got to working on this late today. I worry that my progress is going too slowly.

### Day 11: June 12, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introductory HTML section and worked through a few of the intermediate HTML lessons in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts:** I like the pace of the course. Balancing these tutorials with the more creative fCC projects is keeping things fresh for me.
