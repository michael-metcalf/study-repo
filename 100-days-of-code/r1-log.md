# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 15, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through functions on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Fell off the horse for a couple of weeks. The catalyst was Windows update borking my computer. I nibbled on and off for a little bit, but I'm recommitting today.

### Day 2: August 16, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about scope and higher order functions on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp. Also, Dylan Israel released his podcast, Self-Taught or Not, with Erick Hanchett. I look forward to listening to it.

**Thoughts:** Getting recommitted feels good, but I also need to not be so hard on myself for not adhering to some arbitrary metric like "coding for one hour for 100 days." Be chill, be CONSISTENT, and ENJOY the learning. Don't fret over arbitrary things like *how long* you *learned/studied* coding each day. The question is: Did you *learn* something new today? Did you make even a little *forward* progress, even just 1%? You're okay. You're good to go. Just make sure you're *going*.

### Day 3: August 17, 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Read some of Jon Duckett's JavaScript. Learned about the document model, that JavaScript is an interpreted language and that most major browser's have these interpreters built in, and the concept of separation of concerns.

**Thoughts:** A lazy day, to be honest. I'm not really "gunning for it." But I did recommit and I need to make an effort to stick to that, if anything just so I can believe in myself as someone who can finish what they say they're going to finish.

### Day 4: August 18, 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Introduction to Arrays in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Didn't take advantage of all the time I had today. Just chipping away little by little, but it's too little. I'm not yet fully committed and I don't have anything to show for all this 'study'. I'm just lazy and uninterested. But if I don't do anything then I'll be up shit creek down the road. I'm just motivated by fear and a scrarcity mindset.

### Day 5: August 19, 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the Todo List codealong in Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty stimulating, and time goes by faster when I'm trying to code my own solution to a problem/exercise. Watching videos and coding along can get boring fast. Much better mood today.

### Day 6: August 20, 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Read more of Jon Duckett's Javascript. 

**Thoughts:** Very easy, light day. Just did some bedtime reading.

### Day 7: August 21, 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about array iteration, .forEach, and anonymous/callback functions on the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. 

**Thoughts:** The anonymous/callback function concepts were a little challenging.

### Day 8: August 22, 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Read more of Jon Duckett's Javascript. Still early in the book. Getting around to discussing statements, objects, methods, etc. Apparently there's a different syntax for multi-line comments vs single-line comments. 

**Thoughts:** Again, light bedtime reading. Probably spent too much of the day relaxing.

### Day 9: August 23, 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Did the Todo List 2 codealong in the Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp. Learned about .splice() and a little about refactoring as a way to better organize code. Also, that it's okay to declare functions at the bottom of the code. I guess it's okay since it's in the global scope? 

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to doing the array problem sets.
